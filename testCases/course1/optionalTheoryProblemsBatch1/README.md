## Course 1. Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms

### Optional Theory Problems Batch 1

The following problems are for those of you looking to challenge yourself beyond the required problem sets and programming questions. 
Most of these have been given in Stanford's CS161 course, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, at some point. 
They are completely optional and will not be graded. 
While they vary in level, many are pretty challenging, and we strongly encourage you to discuss ideas and approaches with your fellow students on the "Theory Problems" discussion form.
